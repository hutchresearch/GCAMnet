Input|Scenarios|Scenario implementation
Fossil fuel costs|Low/High|Crude oil, unconventional oil, natural gas, & coal SSP1 (high) & SSP5 (low) resource costs
Emissions|Low/High|CO2 emissions constrained to 2 selected IIASA scenarios; high and low path to 2°C by 2100
Bioenergy constraint|Low/-|Bioenergy taxed to keep total near 100 EJ/year (high), low scenario has no modification from reference behavior

Carbon capture and storage (CCS)|Low/High|High and low carbon storage resource costs
Wind & solar backups|Low/High|Increased (high) or decreased (low) backup requirement based on market share of wind and solar energy
Wind storage costs|Low/High|Higher and lower wind storage capital overnight costs
Wind tech costs|Low/High|Wind and wind offshore capital overnight costs fixed at 2020 values (high); decreasing 2020–2100 (low)
Solar storage costs|Low/High|Higher and lower solar storage capital overnight costs
